# Task Board

My personal task board, an extension for Omnifocus.

## Motivation

I want better focus for my tasks, the default OmniFocus views did not do the trick for me. Especially the aggregation of tasks did feel a little overwhelmed.

And I want to display tasks for this week or for just today (based on my tags). This week is doable in OmniFocus but not today. I have a tag for the Weekday and it's not easily doable in OmniFocus.

The other big reason I wanted to create somethign like this is because I want to record my Moods for the day and how they shift overtime so I can visualize them.
The Notion integration does not work yet but it's only a matter of time :) 
And I wanted to display the tasks for that mood and do some more fancy stuff like showing things based on several tags (urgend and important for example). 

Lot's of stuff that could be doable with OmniFocus but I wanted to play around again with stuff and create things :)
